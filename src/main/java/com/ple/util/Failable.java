/**
 * Failable is a type of Functor which is useful for catching failable methods during runtime and allowing developers the
 * option of forcing the app to exit, or to log or simply continue operations as normal without the framework deciding
 * for them.
 *
 * It has another benefit of skipping further operations on a failed object instead of continuing to fail one operation
 * after another. It will retain the failure message and exception from the original failed method all the way to the
 * end of a chain of .map() functions.
